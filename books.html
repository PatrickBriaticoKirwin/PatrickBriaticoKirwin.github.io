	<h1>Preface on Thinking</h1>
	<p>Most of the books I recommend have some piece or idea that helps one think about issues. I come from a math background, which has a lot of useful tools for thinking. When you understand how a proof works, you can apply that mode of thinking to other problems. The difficulty is most other fields are not nearly as well-defined as math. Creative writing, for example, is not going to benefit from proof-like prose. However if you share the same goal as me, searching for Truth, it is a useful mode of reasoning. Most of the following books add some tool or often hidden information that helps understanding the world we live in.</p>
	<h1>Books</h1>
	<h2>Win Bigly by Scott Adams</h2>
	<p>Adams introduces many interesting psychological concepts. Persuasion, Framing, and Lenses are the big takeaway ideas.</p>
	<h2> The Machiavellians by James Burnham</h2>
	<p>A very good introduction to the Italian school of political science. Each chapter gives at least one useful tool to understand politics from an Elite theory lens. There have been <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B">studies</a> that show this lens to be correct, at least in the context of America.</p>
